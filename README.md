# Edu8Africa-Python-Project
This is a project to assess what I learnt during Edu8Africa prep class for CEHers.
 
##How the application works
 The code generates a random password for users based on the following conditions:
    **1. The user is to provide the length of password to generate**
    **2. The input is then evaluated, if it's an integer, it checks if it meets the minimum value of 12 else an error message is generated for any value entered aside an integer**
    **3. Generated password includes both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.**
